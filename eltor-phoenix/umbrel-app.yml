  To Setup:
  ---------
  Router Port Forward (NAT) 
  
  Make sure to port forward the ORPort on your router if behind NAT. This setting
  is typically found in the "Port Forwarding" section of your router settings. 
  You need to forward port `9996` to the internal IP address of your Umbrel node. For example, 
  if your Umbrel node's internal IP address is 192.168.1.4 then your port forwarding rule would look like this:
  - External Port: `9996`
  - Internal Port: `9996`
  - Internal IP Address: `192.168.1.4`
  - Protocol: `TCP`
  See your router's documentation for specific instructions on how to set up port forwarding or visit
  https://www.wikihow.com/Set-Up-Port-Forwarding-on-a-Router
      
  Or if your router supports UPnP, you can use miniupnp with your Umbrels Local IP address `upnpc -a X.X.X.X 9996 9996 TCP`
